# Bikesharing

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project was to analyze a one month sample of bikeshare data in an urban setting to determine customer demographics and rider details that would make the launch of a bikeshare program successful.  The data file was in a csv format and was cleaned before importing the file into Tableau for analysis.

## Results
This chart shows that short duration trips under 1 hour are the most common trip taken by all customers.

This chart shows the breakdown between subscribers and non-subscribers and their usage times.  Customers who subscribe to the bikeshare service have the highest usage across the board.  Many subscribers have peak times during weekdays and may indicate the program is used for commuting.

## Summary
Overall, the analysis shows that riders use the service heavily for workplace commuting and prefer to access the service through subscription.  The customer base skews heavily towards males.

Visualizations to consider:
* A count of bikes at each starting location and ending location may show insight on how much repositioning might be required.
* A correlation between starting and ending locations may show popular routes to know where to position bikes.
