# Bikesharing

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project was to analyze a one month sample of bikeshare data in an urban setting to determine customer demographics and rider details that would make a launch of a bikeshare program successful.

## Results
This chart shows that short duration trips under 1 hour are the most common trip taken by all customers.

This chart shows the breakdown between subscribers and non-subscribers and their usage times.  Customers who subscribe to the bikeshare service have the highest usage across the board.  Many subscribers have peak times during morning and evening rush hours which leads me to believe this service is heavily used for commuting.
